# Snake

An enhanced version of the classic Snake game.

Features include:

- Advanced Graphics2D board design and textures
- 10 different speed levels
- Score count

## How to Play

Use the arrow or number keys to navigate the snake through the field of grass.
The goal is to swallow as many mice as possible.
Each time a mouse is eaten, the snake grows by one box. A new mouse then appears in a different position.
You lose if you bump into a wall or a space that is already occupied by the snake.
